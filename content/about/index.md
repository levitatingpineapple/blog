This metronome utilizes polygons to visually represent polyrhythms in an easily understandable manner. Automatic per-beat subdivision calculations make it simple to learn complex patterns, such as 7/4/3 or 9/5/4. Simply drag or tap on polygons to activate them, and press play! It is a valuable tool for individuals studying Carnatic Music.\
